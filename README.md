# MP3-toWAV

To use this script, save it as `audio_converter.py` and run it from the command line, providing the input folder containing the MP3 files and the destination folder where the WAV files should be saved as arguments. For example:
`python audio_converter.py input_folder output_folder`

Replace `input_folder` with the path to the folder containing the MP3 files and `output_folder` with the path to the folder where you want to save the converted WAV files. Please note that you will need to have the pydub library installed. You can install it using the command `pip install pydub`.
